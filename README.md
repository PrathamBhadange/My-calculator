## Calculator Web App 🧮

This is my **first ever web development project** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

I created this project as a **starting step in my web development journey**, to understand basic concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple UI styling.

It may be simple, but it represents my **learning, practice, and progress** 🚀
